# 🛡️ ddos_tool_2025

**`ddos_tool_2025`** is an **open-source DDoS stress-testing framework** built for **ethical hacking** and **authorized infrastructure testing** only.  
It provides **multi-layer attacks (L3/L4 & L7)**, **Cloudflare bypass techniques**, and **reflection-based amplification attacks**, giving security researchers a powerful tool for evaluating network resilience.

---

## 🚀 Supported Attacks
- 🔹 **UDP Flood** – Stress test network capacity with high-volume UDP packets.  
- 🔹 **SYN Flood (TCP)** – Exploit TCP handshake to overload server resources.  
- 🔹 **HTTP Flood** – Layer 7 attack leveraging high-rate HTTP requests.  
- 🔹 **Slowloris Attack** – Keeps connections open to exhaust server thread limits.  
- 🔹 **RUDY Attack** – Sends slow, long POST requests for resource exhaustion.  
- 🔹 **NTP Reflection Attack** – Amplified DDoS using vulnerable NTP servers.  
- 🔹 **HTTP Flood (Bypass Cloudflare)** – Evades certain cloud-based protection layers.  
- 🔹 **Layer7 HTTP/1.1 Flood Attack** – High-impact HTTP/1.1 floods.  
- 🔹 **Layer7 HTTP/2 Flood Attack** – Targets HTTP/2 protocols for advanced stress tests.  
- 🔹 **Layer7 WebSocket Flood Attack** – Overwhelms WebSocket connections.
